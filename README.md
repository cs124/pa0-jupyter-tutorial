# PA0 - Environment Setup; Python/Jupyter and NumPy Tutorials

Welcome to the first programming assignment! 
The goal of this assignment is to get your coding environment set up for all 
the future assignments and to provide some useful review of `Jupyter Notebooks`,
`Python`, `Regular Expressions`, and `NumPy`. 

It is ungraded, so once you've got your environment set up correctly and are
satisfied that you understand all the exercises, you are done!
You are not required to submit anything for this assignment.

## Part 1: Environment Setup

Decide where you will be doing your assignments. 
There are a couple of different options that we support to varying degrees. 
You can find our recommendation for what you should choose below. 
Setup instructions referenced below can be found in the `platform`
directory.

* If you have a personal machine you can use that is reasonably 
  modern/performant and is running `MacOS`, `Linux`, or `Windows`, we strongly
  recommend you use that for this class. 
  * __If you have a MacOS machine,__ go to the `MacOS.md` file and follow 
  the instructions there.
  * __If you have a Linux machine,__ go to the `Linux.md` file and follow
  the instructions there.
  * __If you have a Windows machine,__ go to the `Windows.md` file and 
  follow the instructions there.
      
* If you are pretty sure that your personal machine won't work for this class,
reach out to the teaching staff and let them know what your situation is like.
They will try to figure out the best possible option for you. 
Generally, there are two possibilities:
  * __If possible, we first recommend trying to get things working on Google
  Colab.__
  You can find the instructions in the `Google_Colab.md` file.
  * If that is not an option, you can try working remotely on Stanford's 
  `rice`/`myth` machines.
  The instructions can be found in the `Remote.md` file.

If you run into any issues during the process that you can't figure out, please
come to office hours and a CA will be able to help you out.
Alternatively, if you post where you're stuck on our online class discussion 
forum, the teaching staff can help you there as well.

The setup instructions you followed in `Part 1` should have directed you 
through all the steps needed to run `Jupyter Notebooks`.

## Part 2: Python/Jupyter Tutorial

Work through the notebook titled `python_intro.ipynb`, which will teach you the
basics of `Jupyter Notebooks` as well as `Python`. 
We encourage you to work through all of the exercises and answer the questions 
to make sure your `Python` basics are solid. 
We also provide some good practice with `Regular Expressions` that will prove 
very useful for `PA1`, coming up soon.

## Part 3: NumPy Tutorial

We are also providing you with a tutorial on `NumPy`. 
Open the file titled `numpy_intro.ipynb` and work through the examples there.
You don't need to know `NumPy` for `PA1`, but you will work with it in `PA2`.

## Done!

You are done with `PA0`! 
Note that you do not have to submit anything.
