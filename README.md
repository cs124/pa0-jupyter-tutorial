# PA0 - Environment Setup and Python/Jupyter Tutorial

Welcome to the first programming assignment! The goal of this assignment is 
to get your environment set up for all the future assignments and 
to provide some useful review of Python, Jupyter notebooks, and regular 
expressions. 

It is ungraded, so once you've got your environment set up
correctly and are satisfied that you understand all the exercises in the notebook,
you're done! You are not required to submit anything to Gradescope or Canvas, although it does appear
as an assignment there (worth 0 points) for your reference.


## Part 1: Setting up your environment

1. Decide where you'll be doing your assignments. There are a couple of 
   different options that we support to varying degrees. Here's our 
   recommendation for what you should choose:

* If you have a personal machine you can use that is reasonably modern/performant and
is running MacOS, Linux, or Windows, we strongly recommend you use that for this
  class.
    * __If you have a MacOS machine,__ go to the `MacOS_Setup.md` file and follow
    the instructions there.
    * __If you have a Linux machine,__ go to the `Linux_Setup.md` file and follow
the instructions there.
    * __If you have a Windows machine,__ go to the `Windows_Setup.md` file and follow
the instructions there.
      
* If you are pretty sure that your personal machine won't work for this class,
first of all reach out to the teaching staff and let them know what your situation
  is like. They will try to figure out the best possible option for you. Generally, 
  there are two possibilities:
    * __If possible, we first recommend trying to get things working on Google
    Colab.__ You can find the instructions in the `Google_Colab_Setup.md` file.
   * If that is not an option, you can try working remotely on Stanford's rice/myth
    machines. The instructions can be found in the `Remote_Setup.md` file.
  

If you run into any issues during the process that you can't figure out, please
come to office hours and a CA will be able to help you out. Alternatively, if
you post where you're stuck on Piazza, the teaching staff can help you there.

## Part 2: Python/Jupyter Tutorial

1. The instructions you followed in part 2 should have directed you through
all the steps needed to run the Jupyter notebook.
   
2. Once in the notebook, we encourage you to work through all of the exercises
and answer the questions to make sure your Python basics are solid. We also 
   provide some good practice with regular expressions that will prove very
   useful for PA1, coming up soon. Note that you do not have to submit anything,
   as PA0 is not graded.
